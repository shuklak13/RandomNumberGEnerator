# Random Number Generator

This is a random number generator I wrote in C#

## Features

* Can generate up to ~~~~2^31 - 1 = 2147483647~~~~ random numbers per execution!
* Can generate numbers from both Uniform and Normal distributions!

## Motivation

I wanted to generate some random numbers but didn't have an internet connection, so I opened up Visual Studio instead.
